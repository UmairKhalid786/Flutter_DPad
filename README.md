Here's a corrected version:

## Flutter TV D-Pad
Flutter application for handling TV D-pad navigation.

## Getting Started
Locate the widget named DpadWidget in the on_dpad_click_widget.dart file. This widget includes two methods:

1) Function onClick
This method supports D-pad key code 23 and Keyboard Key 66.

2) Function(bool isFocused) onFocus
This method returns true when any interaction happens with it and false when the control moves out.

For more details, navigate to the lib folder and check the on_dpad_click_widget.dart file.
